# Dactyl Trace-Ink

A wireless, Dactyl Tracer with e-ink display.

This is built similarly to the [Dactyl Tracer](https://github.com/mjohns/tracer). I just want run it with ZMK wireless, so no TRRS and added other e-ink mounts.

To build run:
```
cd build
cmake ../src
make && ./keyboard
```

Iterate on it watching for changes:
```
air
```
